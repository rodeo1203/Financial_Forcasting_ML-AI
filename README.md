# Financial Forecasting using Machine Learning
The objective of this project is to predict the quarterly percentage change in revenue for companies in the financial sector. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and XGBoost, we aim to assess their effectiveness in predicting financial metrics.

Updated with some PCA analysis and specific PCA decompostion based on fundamental representation of the features. This significantly improved the performance of the models, across the board.
